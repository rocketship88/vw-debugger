Release .002 :)

This version relaxes the entry max size on the proc source code.
since the default we are using was only 3000 chars, a 500 line
proc might be nearly 30,000 so we'll use 10x for that one, otherwise
most proc's text would have been too big. Dumping this out to the
console is still quite fast since we use only one puts to do it.

current known bugs:

1. global variables defined in a local proc that are not yet defined
cause problems
2. second time calling a proc, we still have the namespace for the proc
around need to clean it up, but we might have a problem with recursion 
here too.

lot's of quoting problems since we are generating code dynamically

so, we're not really even an alpha yet :(
