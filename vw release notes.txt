Release .002 :)

This version relaxes the entry max size on the proc source code.
since the default we are using was only 3000 chars, a 500 line
proc might be nearly 30,000 so we'll use 10x for that one, otherwise
most proc's text would have been too big. Dumping this out to the
console is still quite fast since we use only one puts to do it.
