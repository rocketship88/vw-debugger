Releae .007 nice number, and after this we will rest now

Lots of new stuff. Some of my first debugger code is now in this one
There's 2 new rows in the code stepping window, for typing in commands.
the uplevel is not implemented yet, the other one is like a mini-console
of one line, with up/down arrow, AND an empty line repeats last command
the double clicking of line numbers is now a go to that line (slow enough
to see it do it - we like that, can follow code in an animation)
implemented as g -N and also now the break button, clears the g +/- N and
should cause a stop immediately.
If tooltip package is available, and the config says to use it, we'll try.
The default for the console hack is now off, given the working 1 line console.
the manual (pdf) has more info, but no new screenshots, I'm working on some
videos with my new capture tool. Don't know if you can upload them here.

Release .002 :)

This version relaxes the entry max size on the proc source code.
since the default we are using was only 3000 chars, a 500 line
proc might be nearly 30,000 so we'll use 10x for that one, otherwise
most proc's text would have been too big. Dumping this out to the
console is still quite fast since we use only one puts to do it.
